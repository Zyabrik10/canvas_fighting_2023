THIS IS THE FIRST BETA VERSION. THERE ARE TWO BUGS IN IT THAT I KNOW:
1. WHEN YOU HIT IN HEAD AND IT IS THE LAST HIT WICH OPONENT CAN HADLE THE HAELTH BAR OF OPPONENT DOESN'T MOVE.
2. YOU MIGHT DON'T SEE SPRITES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO RELOAD 2-3 TIMES YOUR PAGE. PRELOADING SPRITES WILL BE DONE SOON.

COMING SOON:
1. BACKGROUND MUSIC
2. VOICE LIKE IN MORTAL COMBAT
3. SUPER HIT WITH CHARGING
4. KIND OF SHURICANS
5. NPC ON BACKROUND
6. MAKE IT TO BE ALSO MOBILE GAME
